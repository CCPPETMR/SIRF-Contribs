# SIRF-Contribs
Users contributions to SIRF.

This space is for contributions that are not quite ready yet to be incorporated into SIRF's main repository. We welcome the sharing of any contributions that might help other researchers. We hope that widely used features can then be finalised, and then added to the main SIRF repository.

Please add your contributions as a pull request, with the new python code located in `src/Python/sirf/contrib`. In this fashion, once a user has checked out this repository, they can use it in their code with, for example:

```
from sirf.contrib import kcl

```

# Current contents
